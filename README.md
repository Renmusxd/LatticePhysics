# LatticePhysics

Setup is just cloning into a directory with:

`git clone https://github.com/Renmusxd/LatticePhysics.git`

Then `cd LatticePhysics` and `make`

Requires xcode command line tools from `xcode-select --install` or otherwise

SDL2 may be required and can be install with `brew install sdl2 sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf`
If that doesn't work try `brew install sdl sdl2 sdl2_mixer sdl2_ttf sdl_image sdl_mixer sdl_ttf` for old sdl as well.
